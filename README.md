# WeatherApp
Getting weather data using vanilla javascript with some arrow functions, fetch api and openweathermap api

# IMPORTANT
Due to security reasons the ajax request from the fetch api cannot be executed from the file path in the browser. To make it work, a local server needs to be set up. In my example I have used http-server, a lightweight local server. To set it up, open the terminal or the command prompt in the current directory and write **npm install http-server -g**  
<br />
After that to run the server, insert the command **http-server [path of the directory of the app] -p 8080**
<br />
After that is done, open the browser and type in the url section http://localhost:8080/
<br />
